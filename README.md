# ðŸŒ¤ Weather Forecast and Prediction using OpenWeatherMap API
This project is a practical data science exploration that combines Python, machine learning, and data visualization to analyze and predict weather trends. Using the OpenWeatherMap API, we fetch real-time weather data for multiple cities, analyze key metrics like temperature and humidity, and apply machine learning techniques to predict future weather patterns.

# ðŸš€ Features
Weather Data Fetching: Retrieve 5-day weather forecasts for multiple cities using the OpenWeatherMap API.
Data Visualization: Plot temperature and humidity trends with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Machine Learning Integration: Predict future weather temperatures using Scikit-learn's Linear Regression model.
Interactive Dashboard: Visualize and interact with the data using Streamlit.
# ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
weather_analysis.py: Contains the Python scripts for fetching, analyzing, and visualizing weather data.
streamlit_app.py: Streamlit-powered dashboard for real-time data interaction.
requirements.txt: List of dependencies for easy setup.
# ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Python (Requests, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
OpenWeatherMap API

# ðŸ“Š Visualizations
Temperature trends across multiple cities.
Humidity levels over time.
Linear regression-based weather predictions.

# ðŸ“ˆ Future Enhancements
Integrate more advanced machine learning models.
Add more weather metrics (e.g., wind speed, air pressure).
Implement predictive analysis for multiple cities simultaneously.
